# Dynagen3

This is port dynagen from sourceforge to python3. 

## Motivation
Sometimes we don't want install and run GNS3 to be able run cisco router simulator. The python2 is dead.  
* Expect slow progress

# Requirements
* dinamips
pip install configobj

## News
* With single blow I ported 5k lines. confobj.py is library already running with python3. Nice.
